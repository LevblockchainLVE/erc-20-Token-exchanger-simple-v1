# erc-20-Token-exchanger-simple-v1
a simple erc20 token exchange smart contract between 2 given tokens and a price. a private ICO, IEO Or whatever....
Test and Initialize the smart contract on remix ide by adding a "companytoken" address and an exchange token address. then if you deployed contract on testnet or mainnet after tests, send to contract your "companytoken" (ie deposit) and set the price balance. Good experimental contract to start simply and use with care along further developing, testing of course.We may use the contract for our own initial fundraising needs.
